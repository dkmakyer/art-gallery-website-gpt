# Git Workflow

1. Initialized my local repo with `git init`.
2. Connected my local repo to the remote repo with `git remote add origin (remote repo url)`.
3. Used `git add .` to stage all the files I worked with.
4. Used `git commit` to save my work.
5. Used `git push` to push my work on the master branch to GitHub.
6. Used `git checkout -b "feature/location"` to create a new branch and dive into it to work.
7. Used `git pull origin master` to synchronize the files pushed into the remote repo, so that they can exist in the feature branch.
8. Repeated steps 3, 4, 5 after working.
